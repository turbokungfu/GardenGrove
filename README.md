This is version 1 of Bryce Neil's social gardening plan. The idea is to connect consumers to gardeners and plot owners to gardeners who want to expand or start gardening projects.


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Mapbox, BootStrap, Node, Express

## Optimizations

This is the epitome of continual improvement. The next steps are to make a proper home page for each garden and allow a farmer to start conversations on that page, as well as to post produce for sale. As we learn more about Bryce's plan, we'll make more changes.

## Lessons Learned:

The mapping and geo-json is probably my biggest lesson. I also started altering the bootstrap without really understanding. I also learned some about modeling before coding, as I am plugging leaks that I make as I alter the flow of information.
